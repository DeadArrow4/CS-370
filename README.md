Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The code I was given included the foundational framework for the intelligent agent and the maze environment. This included classes such as TreasureMaze and GameExperience, which provided methods for observing the environment, performing actions, and managing experience replay.The code I created involved implementing the Q-learning algorithm, which included the logic for training the neural network. I also developed the epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation and implemented mechanisms for tracking performance and fine-tuning the training parameters.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists develop algorithms, design software systems, and apply computational theory to solve complex problems. Their work matters because it drives innovation across industries, improving efficiency, decision-making, and user experiences. For example, in this project, I used machine learning to address a pathfinding challenge, which reflects the practical applications of computer science in solving real-world problems.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems as a computer scientist by analyzing the problem and breaking it into manageable components. I then design algorithms and create a structured plan to address each part of the problem. Implementation is done iteratively, with testing and feedback used to refine and improve the solution until it meets the requirements.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization include ensuring that solutions are reliable, transparent, and aligned with user needs. It is also important to avoid unintended consequences and ensure fairness in the design and application of algorithms. Ultimately, I strive to balance the organizationâ€™s goals with the responsibility to deliver ethical and high-quality work.
